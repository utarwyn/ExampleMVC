# An example of MVC

You want to create your own website with a custom MVC and you need an example of a server side code?

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how specific modules can work to create a MVC like a router, a dispatcher, a database ecosystem, etc. All of that with POO objects.

> Keep in mind that this project is old and not maintain anymore. So be prudent when using a code sample.
